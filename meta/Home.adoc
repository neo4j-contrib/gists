http://neo4j.com[Neo4j] GraphGists are an easy way to create and share documents containing not just prose, structure 
and pictures but most importantly **example graph models and use-cases** expressed in Neo4j's query language http://docs.neo4j.org/refcard/2.1/[Cypher].

These documents are written in AsciiDoc -- the simple, textual markup language -- and rendered in your browser as rich and interactive web pages that you 
can quickly evolve from describing simple howtos or questions to providing an extensive use-case specification.

To see the expressive power of this approach, here are some winners of our past community competitions:

=== Setup a Graph to show you and your Likes

//setup
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(us:Database:NoSql:Graph {name:"Neo4j" })
RETURN you, like, us
----

And render as a graph.

//graph

=== Now query the graph to show all the things you like

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (you:Person {name:"You"})-[like:LIKE]->(liked)
RETURN you.name AS who, type(like) AS how, liked.name AS what
----

And render as a table.

//table
